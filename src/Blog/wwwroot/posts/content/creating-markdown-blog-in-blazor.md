As you can all see in my first post, I was very enthusistic about documenting my journey, but didn't have a place to put that journey. So of course more coding to build a blog site! Here is my journey.

- How to create a blog app in Blazor
  - **Hurdle overcome**: How to store posts statically
- How to parse markdown into html and render
  - **Hurdle overcome**: How to get raw html to render in Blazor
- How to read static markdown via http calls
  -  **Hurdle overcome**: How a "/" is not working in Blazor preview 6.
